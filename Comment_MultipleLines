Commenting with #:

1. visually select the text rows (using V as usual)
2. :norm i#
This inserts "#" on each line. Note that when you type : the range will be filled in, so it will really look like :'<,'>norm i#

Uncommenting #:

1. visually select the text as before (or type gv to re-select the previous selection)
2. :norm x
